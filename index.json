Under PushUDP, I publish deep dives, field notes, and tools to help others spot the blind spots they’re missing or techniques that could be used to leverage your way through defenses. No noise — just signal.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a junior security engineer and researcher who cares about the problems that don\u0026rsquo;t get enough air time: the edge cases, the low-level protocol quirks, the gaps that hide in the seams of “good enough” security controls. UDP is my favorite metaphor for that mindset — fast, connectionless, and often overlooked until it\u0026rsquo;s too late.\nI spend my time building practical tools for defenders and adversary emulators who\u0026rsquo;d rather test assumptions than trust them. I write about covert channels, weird traffic patterns, detection evasion, and the subtle ways attackers slip through when defenders get too comfortable.\nPushUDP isn’t a brand or a company — it’s just an operator’s notebook made public, for people who care about the details.\nAs for the name: Push comes from the assembly mnemonic push; UDP from the connectionless protocol.\n","date":"28 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Push UDP","summary":"","title":"About","type":"page"},{"content":"I’m always working to carve out time for side projects, even while balancing life and a job. Many of these projects never make it to a public release, but they serve as valuable opportunities to experiment, apply new ideas in real-world contexts, and learn from the process.
